Neutrino detection is entering a new era with a number of large precision neutrino detectors, specifically Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers (LArTPCs), now in design and construction both for long and short baseline neutrino oscillation experiments.  The {\bf{Micro}} {\bf{Boo}}ster {\bf{N}}eutrino {\bf{E}}xperiment, henceforth referred to as MicroBooNE, will be the first large ($\sim$100 tons) \lartpc to operate in the United States and the second only after ICARUS to operate worldwide.  \lartpc detectors combine fine-grained tracking with total absorption calorimetry to provide excellent signal efficiency and background rejection.  

The MicroBooNE experiment combines physics goals of short-baseline oscillations and neutrino cross-section measurements with development goals to inform larger scale construction of \lartpcs for the long-baseline program.  MicroBooNE's principal physics goal is to address long standing unsolved puzzles generated by short-baseline neutrino oscillation results from past experiments. The LSND collaboration measured an oscillation rate of antimuon neutrinos to antielectron neutrinos not compatible with the solar or atmospheric oscillation parameters \cite{solar}.  The size of the observed signal suggests a mass squared difference of neutrino masses of the order of  about 1~eV, which could only be accommodated with an additional neutrino mass eigenstate. Since the weak interaction only couples to three neutrino eigenstates, an additional neutrino is called sterile, i.e. not coupling to other fermions except via the oscillation mechanism. 

Other hints come from a re-analysis of the expected reactor antineutrino flux that suggests a deficit of reactor neutrinos \cite{reactor anomaly}, and the analysis of calibration data taken by GALLEX and SAGE \cite{gallexSage}. The MiniBooNE experiment \cite{miniboone} also investigated (anti)muon- to (anti)electron-neutrino oscillations and found a further significant deviation from the expectation in the number of electron (anti)neutrino candidates at low energy. The excess of electromagnetic-like events can be attributed to electrons or single photons since these are indistinguishable in the MiniBooNE Cerenkov imaging detector. 

While each of the above results taken alone does not reach the statistical significance to claim a discovery, combining them together can provide indication for oscillations or other unexpected phenomena. Definitive evidence for sterile neutrinos would constitute a revolutionary discovery, with strong implications for particle physics as well as for cosmology. Proposals to address these signals by employing reactor, accelerator, and radioactive source experiments are in the planning stages or underway worldwide. 
 
MicroBooNE will address this issue at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) with the same beam and baseline as MiniBooNE but by employing the \lartpc technology to efficiently separate electrons from photons.  In addition to MicroBooNE's signature oscillation analyses, a suite of precision cross-section measurements will be performed, critical both for future \lartpc oscillation experiments and for what can be learned about neutrino interactions in general.   In the energy range of interest, multiple interaction processes (quasi-elastic, resonances, deep inelastic scattering) are possible, and complicated nuclear effects in neutrino interactions on argon result in a variety of final states. These can range from the emission of several nucleons to more complex topologies with multiple pions, all in addition to the leading lepton in charged-current events. The \lartpc technology employed by MicroBooNE is particularly well suited to this purpose because of its excellent particle identification capability and calorimetric energy reconstruction down to very low detection thresholds. MicroBooNE will also be supernova live and capable of detecting a galactic supernova, and prepare the analysis of  the search for proton decays. For the latter analysis the experiment will not have a competitive sensitivity due to too small target mass. However, this will be an important scientific goal towards future measurements in larger detectors.  

On a longer time scale, a phased program is being pursued at Fermilab centered around the existing Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB) and the Neutrinos from the Main Injector (NuMI) beam. The MicroBooNE experiment is located 470~m from the BNB production target and 600~m from the NuMI production target.  MicroBooNE began operations in late 2015 for a $\sim$3 year time period, extending into the era of the full Short Baseline Neutrino (SBN) program beginning in 2018 with the commencement of operations of the SBND \cite{send} and ICARUS experiments, located at 100m and 600m respectively from the BNB production target.  MicroBooNE will definitively address whether or not the MiniBooNE low energy excess in neutrino mode is due to electrons or photons.  SBND will look for this low energy excess at the near location (100m) from the production target, and the three detectors combined will cover the entire LSND allowed region in neutrino parameter space to 5$\sigma$ through $\nu_e$ appearance.

As mentioned above, the \lartpc technique will be used by MicroBooNE at a relatively large scale, so far only surpassed by the ICARUS T600 detector. The potential of liquified noble gases to be employed as the detection media in particle detectors with high spatial resolution was recognized already in the 1960's (see, e.g., Ref.~\cite{Doke:1993}). Large calorimeters for the measurement of particle energy were then realized by using cryogenic noble liquids as active components (see, e.g., Ref.~\cite{Willis:1974}). Furthermore, the \lartpc was proposed at CERN by C.~Rubbia in 1977~\cite{Rubbia:1977} as a detector capable of providing uniform and precise imaging of large volumes. 

The original \lartpc idea was extensively developed by an intense ICARUS R\&D program. Various prototype detectors were realized and operated to develop the systems needed for larger physics experiments such as purification methods, signal readout electronics, and cryogenics. The largest ICARUS test device had a mass of about 3 tons of LAr~\cite{Benetti:1993-3ton,Cennini:1994-3ton} and allowed for the collection of large samples of cosmic-ray events. In parallel, a smaller volume detector (50 liters of LAr) was exposed to the CERN WANF neutrino beam allowing the detection of neutrino interaction events for the first time in a \lartpc~\cite{Arneodo:1999-50l}. 

The largest \lartpc detector built so far is the 600-ton ICARUS T600 detector, which was also tested with cosmic rays at the surface~\cite{Amerio:2004-T600}. Measurements from this activity showed that the technique can successfully operate at large scales with a drift length as long as 1.5~m~\cite{Amoruso:2004-muon,Amoruso:2004-electron,Antonello:2004-cherenkov,Amoruso:2004-purity,Arneodo:2003-tracks}. The T600 was then moved to LNGS, and subsequently operated in the CNGS neutrino beam for a muon- to tau-neutrino oscillation search. 

The success of the construction of the T600 motivated several follow up ideas aimed at reaching even higher target masses (see, e.g., Ref.~\cite{Aprili:2002-proposal}). A monolithic magnetized large mass device was proposed in~\cite{Cline:2003-LANNDD}, based on the scaling up of the ICARUS approach. The ICARUS experience led then to the broader development of the \lartpc concept. A \lartpc design envisioning a single cylindrical volume of 70~m diameter and 20~m height, called GLACIER, was discussed in~\cite{Rubbia:2004-glacier,Rubbia:2009-glacier}, based on a double-phase readout. This approach eventually evolved to the LAGUNA~\cite{LAGUNAcollab} proposal and to the LAGUNA LBNO~\cite{Stahl:2012-LBNO,Agarwalla:2013-LBNO} conceptual design, aimed at a large detector placed along a long-baseline beam from CERN to an European underground site. A test device is currently under construction at CERN, in the framework of the WA105 R\&D project~\cite{WA105collab}. In the United States, an analogous multi-kton detector was proposed using conventional single-phase wire readout for the LBNE project~\cite{Adams:2013-LBNE}, aimed at a long-baseline neutrino beam sent from Fermilab to the Sanford Laboratory in South Dakota.  

In parallel, \lartpcs were also considered for short-baseline neutrino experiments, motivating the use of relatively smaller size devices. A first proposal was submitted for the T2K neutrino beam~\cite{Ereditato:2005,Ereditato:2006}.  These ideas were backed by vigorous R\&D programs still in progress in Bern~\cite{Rossi:2009-UVlaser,Badhrees:2012-argontube,Ereditato:2013-argontube,Zeller:2013-argontube}, at ETH Zurich~\cite{Horikawa:2010-ethz,Badertscher:2011-ethz,Badertscher:2012-ethz,Cantini:2013-ethz}, as well as in the United States~\cite{Baller:2014-USlarrd}. At Fermilab, the first \lartpc to be successfully operated in the NuMI beam was the ArgoNeuT detector~\cite{Anderson:2012-argoneut,Acciarri:2013-argoneut-recomb,Anderson:2012-argoneut-CCincl,Acciarri:2014-argoneut-CCxsec,Acciarri:2014-argoneut-CCcohpi} that, despite the relatively small mass of $\sim170$~kg, has been able to perform a series of detailed studies on the interaction of medium-energy neutrinos\cite{argoneutpapers}.  Other critical development projects are currently underway at Fermilab such as ~\cite{Cavanna:2014-lariat,Szelc:2013-lariatlight,Adamowski:2014-LAPD,Rebel:2011-MTS,Montanari:2013-35ton}, all geared towards development of the technology and of analyzing particle interactions in the detectors.   The goal of the development in the near term is towards the SBN program experiments, and in the farther term, following the recent recommendations of the P5 panel~\cite{P5:2014}, the LBNF project and the DUNE experiment which envisions an internationally coordinated effort for the realization of an intense neutrino beam facility at Fermilab and a far large mass neutrino detector in a long-baseline configuration ($>1000$~km). 

More information on the \lartpc technology can be found in existing reviews (see, e.g.,~\cite{Marchionni:2013} and references therein).
 
 \paragraph{Organization of Document}

This document describes the design, construction, and technical details of the MicroBooNE experiment.  Section \ref{sec:overview} gives a brief review of the \lartpc technique and its implementation in MicroBooNE.  Section~\ref{sec:cryostat} describes the design and construction of the cryogenic and purification systems which are required for maintaining a stable volume of highly purified liquid argon.  The \lartpc detector described in section~\ref{sec:tpc-all} is the centerpiece of the experiment, providing fine-grained images of neutrino interactions.  A light collection system, described in section~\ref{sec:light-collection}, provides precise timing information by viewing the detector volume and recording signals from the scintillation light that is produced therein. Signals from the light collection system and from the \lartpc are amplified, sampled, and recorded by a custom-designed electronic and readout system, as described in section~\ref{sec:electronics}.  Section \ref{sec:slow-control} describes the auxiliary instrumentation that monitor and control the detector and all of its associated systems, as well as provide an electrically quiet environment for the experiment to operate. Finally, one of the main calibration sources for the experiment is an ultraviolet laser system, described in section~\ref{sec:laser}, that provides the capability to map out the performance of the \lartpc detector.
