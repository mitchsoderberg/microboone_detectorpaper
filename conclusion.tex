\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

The MicroBooNE detector is the culmination of several years of development and construction.  It is the largest \lartpc ever constructed in the U.S., and innovations such as custom cold electronics and filling without evacuation represent major technological advances that future experiments will build upon.  Operations of MicroBooNE began in the summer of 2015, and a cosmic ray tagger system was added in the fall of 2016.  Future publications will be dedicated to describing the performance of the detector systems introduced in this paper.
