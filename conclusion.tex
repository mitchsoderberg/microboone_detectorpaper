\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

The MicroBooNE detector is the culmination of several years of development and construction.  Innovations such as custom cold (in-liquid) electronics, non-evacuated cryostat, 2.5~m drift, and a UV laser calibration system represent major technological advances that future experiments will build upon.  Operations of MicroBooNE began in the summer of 2015, and a cosmic ray tagger system was added in the fall of 2016.  Future publications will be dedicated to describing the performance of the detector systems introduced in this paper.
