\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

The MicroBooNE detector is the culmination of several years of development and construction.  It is the largest \lartpc ever constructed in the U.S., and represents a major technological advance that future experiments will build upon.  Operations of MicroBooNE began in the summer of 2015, and future publications will be dedicated to describing the performance of the detector systems described in this paper.
