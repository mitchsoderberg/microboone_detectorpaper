An alignment laser (visible light) is introduced along the UV-laser path at the first dichroic mirror (M1), such that the paths overlap. In the attenuator the UV-laser beam intensity can be adjusted to the desired level, and the diameter of the beam is controlled by an aperture. A motorized mirror (M2) deflects the light into the direction of the feedthrough. Beam dumps (BD) are installed behind all mirrors to absorb the non-reflected laser light.
